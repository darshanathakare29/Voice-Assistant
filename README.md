# Voice-Assistant
#Overview:
This mini project is a simple Python application that allows users to search for information on Wikipedia and have the results read aloud using a text-to-speech (TTS) engine.

#Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive and accessible way for users to obtain information from Wikipedia. It is particularly useful for individuals who prefer auditory learning or have visual impairments that make reading from a screen challenging.

#Features:
1. User Input: The application prompts the user to enter a search term.
2. Wikipedia Search: It fetches a brief summary (first two sentences) of the Wikipedia article corresponding to the search term.
3. Text-to-Speech: The summary is printed on the screen and read aloud using a TTS engine.
   
#Procedure :
1. intstall wikipedia and pyttsx3 libraries by using pip.
2. import these libraries in your python script.
3. after that we'll start writing the for this mini project-
     1. intialize text-to-speech engine
     2. get the user input
     3. search wikipedia
     4. Print the summary to the console and use the pyttsx3 engine to read it out loud.
